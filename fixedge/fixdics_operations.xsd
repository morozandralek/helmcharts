delivered (the "Licensee"). The use of this software is subject to
license terms.

The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Software and Documentation

undertaking of confidentiality and non-disclosure, in addition to any other
legal remedies which may be available, and the licensee consents to the
obtaining of such injunctive relief. All of the undertakings and
obligations relating to confidentiality and non-disclosure, whether
contained in this section or elsewhere in this agreement, shall survive
the termination or expiration of this agreement for a period of five (5)
years.

The Licensor agrees that any information or data received from the Licensee
in connection with the performance of the support agreement relating to this
